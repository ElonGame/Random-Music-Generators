I found 2 frameworks on github for the MIDI thing:

- https://github.com/grimmdude/MidiWriterJS - * going with this one - works, seems better for rhythm.
- https://github.com/walmik/scribbletune - (in case above doesn't work)


I was looking into the best way to 'require' node modules in sites, and standard practice seems to be using browserify.org

Making a file available for download:
* [javascript allow user to download file - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+allow+user+to+download+file&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS579US579&oq=javascript+allow+user&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2.4608j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

The data URI ideas I've seen work before. Depends how file is encoded.

Server ideas:

- Github pages
- Heroku
- ?


Confirmed note 60 = C4 = Middle C. Some standards its C3, some C4, some C5.
