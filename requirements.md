# Random-Music-Generators

I found 2 frameworks on github for the MIDI thing:

- https://github.com/walmik/scribbletune - looks easier
- https://github.com/grimmdude/MidiWriterJS - the developer seems cool

I was looking into the best way to 'require' node modules in sites, and standard practice seems to be using browserify.org
